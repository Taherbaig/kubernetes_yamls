kubernetes Deep Dive:

1) kubernetes components and responsibility
    controller nodes:
      kube-apiserver
      kube-control-manager/cloud-control-manager
      kube-schduler
      calico,flannel(deprecated from 1.18),wavenet etc.,
      coreDNS
      etcd key-value pair storage
      kubelet
      kube-proxy
      Docker Engine/containerd/cri-o etc.,
    compute nodes:
      kubelet
      kube-proxy
      Docker Engine/containerd/cri-o etc.,

2) Deployment of kubernets cluster using microk8s(ubuntu),minikube,kubeadm
    Three nodes (1 for controller and 2 for compute nodes)

3) POD object creation using single container and multi-container
    Understanding common networking and common storage in POD (shared namespaces)
    Sample application deployment using nginx for single container in POD
    Multi-container deployment, one for web application and second for data pull
    POD creation with initContainer advantages for pre-request
    static POD deployment
    Deploying application from Private repository
    resource allocation like CPU and MEMORY

4) ReplicationController object (RC)
    When to use replication controller?
    Disadvanatages of deploying application with single POD
    Understanding template and selector parameters

5) ReplicaSet object (RS)
    Difference between RreplicationController and ReplicaSet
    Advantages of adding matchLabels
    when to use replicaSet?

6) Deployment object (deploy)
    Advantages of Deployment over POD, RC and RS
    Sample application deployment like Jenkins, nginx and capture the advantages over other objects
    Scaleout and Scalein for Deployment
    Deployment Stratagies like RollingUpdate and ReCreate difference
    Rollout, Rollback and RolloutHistory of deployment

7) Daemonset object (DS)
    DaemonSet usecases over deployment object
    Advantages of using monitoring tools to deploy through DaemonSet obejct
    Deployment Stratagies like RollingUpdate and OnDelete difference
    Rollout, Rollback and RolloutHistory of DaemonSet

8) StatefulSet object (sts)
    Difference between stateful and stateless applications
    StatefulSet application deployment advantages
    Scaleout and Scalein for Deployment
    Deployment Stratagies like RollingUpdate and OnDelete difference
    Rollout, Rollback and RolloutHistory of StatefulSet

9) volumes:
    empheimeral and persistant storage differences
    Different types of volume plugins like emptyDir, hostPath, NFS etc.,
    Do's and Dont's of using volumes for application deployment

10) PersistentVolume, PersistantVolumeClaim and StorageClass (PV and PVC)
     Advanatages of using PV over volume plugins for data dependent applications
     Static and Dynamic PV creation
     PVC assignment in POD, Deployment, Daemonset, StatefulSet objects
     StargaeClass creation for Dynamic provision
     NFS, Ceph RBD storage as examples

11) Services (svc)
     Exposing application running on different object through service
     Understanding differenece between ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancing, ExternalIP and ExternalName
     When to use these different types of services?

12) secrets and configmap (secret, cm)
     How to pass sensitive data through secret like certs, password, token etc.,
     How to pass paintext data through configMap like configuration files, scripts etc.,
     Using secret in POD object through env and volumes
     using configMap in POD object through env and volumes

13) Ingress (ing)
     Access application deployed with the cluster through IngressController
     Deploying Nginx IngressController
     Ingress rules creation secured and non-secure communication

14) Horizontal POD AutoScalling (HPA):
     HPA deployent to test auto scalling
     Deployment of metric server to achieve HPA

15) Scheduling and probes
     Different types of scheduling like nodename, nodeSelector, podAffinity, podAntiAffinity, nodeAffinity
     Advantages of using liveness, readiness and startup probes to verify application availability

16) Jobs and CronJobs
     How to achieve auto backup and restore using CronJobs for application like etcd key-value pair storage
     for kubernetes cluster
     Jobs responsibility

17) calico networking
     How to migrate from flannel to calico?
     How to use flannel for POD networking and Calico for network security
     calicoctl operations
     network policy and PSP (POD Security Policy)

18) authetication and authorization
     authetication:
       user, group and serviceaccount (token), certs
       kubeconfig entries and access multiple cluster through kubernetes config file
     autherization:
       Role Back Access Control (RBAC)
       role, rolebinding, clusterrole, clusterrolebinding

19) Dashboard
      deployment of kubernetes dashboard and creating kubernetes object through dashboard
      How to autheticate to dashboard through token and kubeconfig

20) Task:
      a. wordpress and database application deployment
      b. connecting frontend and backend application
      c. Jenkins deployment with data persistent after upgrading/downgrade application
      d. Backup and restore of etcd service data
      e. kubernetes upgrade from one version to another (1.17.5 to 1.18.1)
      f. maintaince task using taint and toleration
